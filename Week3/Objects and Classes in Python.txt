Objects and Classes in Python

Objects = A bundle of related attributes and methods.
        Attributes can be thought of as "variables".
        A method is a "function" that belongs within an object.
        Simply what objects have = Attributes and what they can do = Methods.
Examples: 
        1. A phone: 
                    Attributes:
                        Version = 13
                        Price = $599.99
                        is_On = True or False etc.
                    Methods:
                        def is_call
                        def take_pic
                        def_endcall etc.

        2. A cup:
                    Attributes:
                        is_Hot = True or False
                        liquid = "Coffee" / "Tea" and many more
                        is_empty = True or False etc.
                    Methods:
                        def fill_cup
                        def empty_cup
                        def drink_cup

        2. A book:
                    Attributes:
                        is_open = True or False
                        pages = 310
                        title = "The Hobbit"
                    Methods:
                        def open_book()
                        def close_book()
                        def read_book()

Classes = We need to use a class to create many objects.
	  A class is like a blueprint which is used to design the structure and layout of an object.
