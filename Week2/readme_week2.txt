I had learnt to handle files and developed some debugging muscle in this week.

I had created a file organizer which scans a folder and organizes it based on three folders being text documents,
PDF's and image documents.

I had created an expense logger which can be used to keep track of your expenses.
The program is designed so that we need to input the date and the particular expenses on that day.
I added some try and except statements to develop some debugging muscle.

I learnt about file reading and appending modes more deeply.
